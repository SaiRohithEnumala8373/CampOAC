## About

We are developing a mobile-friendly website to help the general public obtain
campfire wood. The user will select the location (from a list of available locations)
and the desired number of bags of firewood on the website. Then, they will receive an email
with an invoice generated based on the pricing and quantity ordered. The website then processes
payment or retains an invoice for cash payment at pick-up time. The receipt is automatically generated.
Users groups include local residents as well as tourists, most people who need a smaller quantity of wood
as for larger orders people would be more likely to turn to a bulk supplier.

### Documentation Manual

Entire program located in <b>react-app</b> folder

Font and graphics elements located in <b>build</b> and <b>public</b> folders

Main application broken into two parts: <b>server</b> and <b>src</b>

<b>src</b> contains frontend functionality:  
  -Display pages located in <b>pages</b> folder and functions  
  -Styling information in <b>css</b> folder  
  -index.js manages display and navigation
  
<b>server</b> contains backend functionality:  
  -<b>models</b> folder contains database schema for mongoDB  
  -index.js has endpoints to handle all API calls and server communication  

Frontend page functionalities such as placing orders or viewing databases make API call from frontend which is then received in appropriate handler in backend server/index.js

Example workflow for placing order with credit payment:  
  1. User lands on home page and navigates to order page (handled by src/index.js)  
  2. Order page makes API call to view current locations  
  3. API call received by server/index.js which communicates with database server and returns location info  
  4. order page displays LocationForm to let user view locations and select one  
  5. user selects location  
  6. location selection passed to OrderForm component  
  7. order page changes display to OrderForm component to let user enter info and place order  
  8. user enters info and places order  
  9. OrderForm makes API call  
  10. API call received by server/index.js which sends order info to database  
  11. OrderForm passes order info to Payment component  
  12. order page changes display to Payment component to let user enter payment info and pay  
  13. user enters payment info and pays  
  14. Payment makes API call  
  15. API call received by server/index.js which handle payment with Square  
  16. invoice generated by server/index.js and sent to user
