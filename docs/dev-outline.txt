Database schema:

Order schema needs a reference to Location
Location schema: { name: string, stock: number, active: boolean }
  active flag allows for admins to temporarily close a location for whatever reason
  stock allows for admin to change stock
  name will be used in the order schema to link orders with specific locations when admin needs to filter orders.
User schema: {}
